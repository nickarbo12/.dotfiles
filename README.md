# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

# .gitignore
This is telling Git to ignore certain files/directories so that they are not pushed to Github.

# linux.sh
I first checked that the operating system was linux by using an if-else statement that returned an error if it was not linux.

# cleanup.sh
This was to reverse anything we did inside of linux.sh

# Makefile
This made two targets which each will run the scripts I created.
